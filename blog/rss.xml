            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey all. This thing happened we should tell you about.</p><p>While performing platform upgrades, we found a bug in Intercode, the website code used by conventions such as Intercon. It has since been fixed.</p><p>This bug created an exploit where people with leadership access to one Intercode convention could use certain permissions on any convention. As a reminder, not even admins have access to your passwords or financial information.</p><p>Due to the technical complexity of accessing the exploit and the small number of people who had the permissions required to take advantage of this, we don’t think it was used, but can’t prove it.</p><h2>What Happened?</h2><p>It’s technically possible con leadership from one convention looked at or modified information for conventions they should not have had access to. We don’t think anyone did, and it’s since been fixed, but here’s the low down.</p><p>There’s a function called “Become user” which certain people on the convention team have permissions for. Just like it sounds, it lets people see the convention website as if they were logged in as the selected user. It’s used for things like running the convention, debugging, and accessing the website on behalf of a user at their request. It does not allow access to anyone’s passwords or payment information.</p><p>This permission is fairly restricted and convention specific. That being said, if you had Become user permissions on one convention using Intercode, it turns out there was a way to then Become user on any Intercode convention. It would involve coding and would not be easy, but it was possible. For example, someone with admin access to Intercon S could have accessed admin functions on Be-Con 2019, including viewing and modifying event and attendee data.</p><h2>What Are We Doing About This?</h2><p>The bug has been fixed and the exploit is gone. We’ve also reviewed the list of people who have Become user permissions on any Intercode site. Considering the difficulty of finding the exploit, the technical expertise required to use it, and the limited set of people who have the necessary permissions, we think it’s really unlikely anyone did so. That being said, we can’t prove a negative.</p><p>A post-mortem was held to document the exploit, which you can find at: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ov8jFIpExWn-elUBXtRd22BwoIQGSbWMFio_iTL9IRM/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ov8jFIpExWn-elUBXtRd22BwoIQGSbWMFio_iTL9IRM/edit?usp=sharing</a>. It includes timelines and technical details for the interested.</p><p>And of course, we’re now telling you about it. We take the safety and security of our community very seriously, which means owning up to our mistakes. We apologize this happened at all, and we&#x27;re even more sorry it took us so long to notice it.</p><p>Thanks for your faith in us.</p><p>The Intercode Team<br/>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Intercode can now forward emails recieved by a convention domain to appropriate staff members. For example, if your convention is hosted at 2020.example.com, and you have a staff position called Webmaster whose contact email is set as <a href="mailto:webmaster@2020.example.com">webmaster@2020.example.com</a>, Intercode can now automatically forward emails received at that address to all the people in that staff position.</p><p>Additionally, staff positions can now have CC addresses (which will also receive email sent to that staff position) and aliases (additional email addresses that can be used to contact that staff position).</p><p>In order to take advantage of this feature, conventions will need to set the MX record on their domain name appropriately. If you&#x27;d like to do this, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hosting@neilhosting.net">hosting@neilhosting.net</a> for instructions!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#x27;re rolling out some changes to how the schedule and run buckets display in Intercode 2. Here’s the highlights:</p><h2>Schedule</h2><ul><li>Instead of having a thin green bar that empties as people sign up for an event, the event will have rounded ends, and act as a progress bar that goes up as people sign up. Once the event is full, it will be lightened to show that it is full.</li><li>Events that have unlimited slots will remain rectangular, and have a gradient background to show that you can sign up for them.</li><li>Events that have no slots (i.e. consuite) will remain rectangular, and have a solid background.</li><li>The &quot;you are signed up for this game&quot; has changed to a user/head icon instead of the checkbox that looked like an interactive element.</li><li>The concom only &quot;Schedule With Counts&quot; view has been updated to show the percentage of signups in the same style, as a background progress bar on each event.</li><li>The sorting of events on the schedule has been updated to better group multiple runs of events together if they’re sequential.</li></ul><h3>Schedule Legend Example</h3><p><img src="news_20191003_legend.png" alt="The new schedule legend view, showing examples of types of event"/></p><h2>Signup Buckets</h2><ul><li>Instead of having a broken line that turns from colored segments to gray, we’re displaying a set of empty circles that get replaced by the same user/head icon that we use on the schedule as people sign up. This should be easier to read at a glance.</li><li>When you click on a run in the schedule view, the same set of circles/heads are displayed there as well.</li></ul><h3>Signup Bucket Examples</h3><p><img src="news_20191003_run.png" alt="The view of an event run from its event page, showing the lines of empty circles for open slots"/></p><p><img src="news_20191003_popup.png" alt="The view of an event run from the schedule grid, showing the reorganized popup view with lines of empty circles"/></p>]]></content:encoded>
