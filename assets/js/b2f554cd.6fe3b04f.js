Here\u2019s the highlights:\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Schedule\\n\\n- Instead of having a thin green bar that empties as people sign up for an event, the event will have rounded ends, and act as a progress bar that goes up as people sign up. Once the event is full, it will be lightened to show that it is full.\\n- Events that have unlimited slots will remain rectangular, and have a gradient background to show that you can sign up for them.\\n- Events that have no slots (i.e. consuite) will remain rectangular, and have a solid background.\\n- The \\"you are signed up for this game\\" has changed to a user/head icon instead of the checkbox that looked like an interactive element.\\n- The concom only \\"Schedule With Counts\\" view has been updated to show the percentage of signups in the same style, as a background progress bar on each event.\\n- The sorting of events on the schedule has been updated to better group multiple runs of events together if they\u2019re sequential.\\n\\n### Schedule Legend Example\\n\\n![The new schedule legend view, showing examples of types of event](news_20191003_legend.png)\\n\\n## Signup Buckets\\n\\n- Instead of having a broken line that turns from colored segments to gray, we\u2019re displaying a set of empty circles that get replaced by the same user/head icon that we use on the schedule as people sign up. This should be easier to read at a glance.\\n- When you click on a run in the schedule view, the same set of circles/heads are displayed there as well.\\n\\n### Signup Bucket Examples\\n\\n![The view of an event run from its event page, showing the lines of empty circles for open slots](news_20191003_run.png)\\n\\n![The view of an event run from the schedule grid, showing the reorganized popup view with lines of empty circles](news_20191003_popup.png)"}]}')}}]);
